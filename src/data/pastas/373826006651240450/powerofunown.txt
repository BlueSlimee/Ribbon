Some may prefer Alakazam as their Psychic-type of choice, probably thanks to its magnificent moustache, or perhaps the slow and ugly Reuniclus. However, Unown does the job of a Psychic-type just as well this generation as always. To be blunt, it is unknown why one would choose not to use Unown. Unchanged from DPP, it deals with most of the OU threats that would otherwise roam freeâ€”unless it gets hit first, of course.

This is Unown's master moveset, perfect and beautiful in its design. Unown is the most versatile of all Pokemon; it can choose from any of the three suggested Hidden Powers to counter the great powerhouses of OU. The damage calculations below showcase its might against the puny Dragon-types and other plebeians weak to Hidden Power Ice:

It can even OHKO Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage! Unown becomes so powerful that it is also able to crush many other dangerous OU threats, swiftly dispatching them to the depths of Hell they should have never left, should it choose Hidden Power Fighting:

252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Fighting vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Magnezone: 65.95 - 78.01%

252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Fighting vs. 0 HP / 0- SpD Cloyster: 147.71 - 174.27%
But that's not all! The third option, being the powerful STAB Psychic-type Hidden Power, will tear to shreds other important opposing forces, such as:

252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Psychic vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Venusaur: 84.38 - 100.33%
252+ SpA Choice Specs Unown Hidden Power Psychic vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Keldeo: 86.06 - 102.16%

After all, who doesn't want almighty and powerful sweepers like Magikarp OHKOed? Unown is a solid staple in any team and it will not deceive you. The ability to OHKO Toxicroak with its superior Psychic-type powers will come in handy when you have to face the troublesome rain teams that plague the current metagame. All of the OU powerhouses will, ultimately, fall to Unown's might.

You could run a Timid nature, but Unown does not need to be fast; remember, it has the superb Hidden Power at its disposal. However, the all-powerful Unown will probably have just one chance to attack before it faints, so it may need the Speed against faster foes.

Because Dark-types are mean to Unown and will try to Crunch its feeble body, it's generally a good idea to team it up with bullies such as Conkeldurr or Terrakion, who will gladly take the attack and answer with a brutal, well-thrown Fighting-type move. Lucario, the OU Fighting-type outcast, will gladly help Unown as well with its powerful Extreme Speed. The mean Ghost-types of OU, Gengar and Jellicent, as well as the hyped-up but less powerful Psychic-types, Alakazam and Reuniclus, may try to hit Unown with a pesky Shadow Ball; therefore it is recommended to pair Blissey or Chansey with Unown, as they will gladly take Shadow Ball. Steel-types that can deal with these opponents are also helpful, such as Skarmory and Heatran, as they are friendly towards Unown and respect it enough to protect its life and vanquish its foes. Unown will enjoy any type of support your team can give: Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Light Screen, Reflect, and spreading paralysis help it shine and let it do its work. In fact, it's highly recommended that you enact your support before letting Unown unleash its fury because, as they say, you'd be better safe than sorry.

Unown might not look like the fittest member of your team, but it is a really solid Pokemon that's remained throughout the years because it's never had to change at all! Unown's great power, coverage and movepool allow it to sweep unprepared teams that are unaware of its might.
